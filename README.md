# Real-Time Collaborative To-Do Board - Project Overview

## Project Summary
I developed a full-stack collaborative to-do board application that enables multiple users to manage tasks in real-time with live synchronization, similar to Trello but with custom business logic and conflict resolution.

## Technical Stack
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Socket.IO for WebSockets
**Frontend:** React with custom CSS (no UI frameworks)

## Core Features Implemented

### Backend Development
- **Secure Authentication:** User registration/login with bcrypt password hashing and JWT-based authentication
- **Task Management API:** RESTful endpoints for complete CRUD operations with task properties (title, description, assigned user, status, priority)
- **Real-Time Sync:** WebSocket implementation using Socket.IO for instant updates across all connected users
- **Action Logging:** Comprehensive logging system tracking every user action with timestamps and user attribution
- **Conflict Detection:** System to identify simultaneous edits and provide resolution options

### Frontend Development
- **Custom UI:** Hand-built login/register forms and Kanban board with three columns (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- **Drag & Drop:** Interactive task management with smooth drag-and-drop between columns
- **Live Activity Feed:** Real-time display of last 20 actions with automatic updates
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly interface that works seamlessly across devices
- **Custom Animations:** Smooth transitions and visual feedback for enhanced user experience

## Unique Business Logic

### Smart Assignment Algorithm
Implemented intelligent task assignment that automatically assigns tasks to the user with the fewest current active tasks, optimizing workload distribution across the team.

### Advanced Conflict Resolution
Built sophisticated conflict handling that detects simultaneous edits, presents both versions to users, and allows them to choose between merging changes or overwriting with their preferred version.

### Custom Validation
- Task titles must be unique per board
- Task titles cannot match column names
- Real-time validation with user feedback

## Technical Challenges Solved
- **Real-time synchronization** across multiple concurrent users
- **State management** for complex application workflows
- **Performance optimization** with efficient database queries and minimal re-rendering
- **Security implementation** with proper authentication and input validation

## Key Accomplishments
Successfully integrated frontend and backend with seamless real-time collaboration, implemented custom business logic for smart task assignment and conflict resolution, and created a responsive interface entirely with custom styling. The application demonstrates comprehensive full-stack development skills while solving real-world collaboration challenges through innovative technical solutions.

## Skills Demonstrated
Full-stack development, real-time systems, WebSocket implementation, React state management, custom UI design, database optimization, security best practices, and responsive web design.
